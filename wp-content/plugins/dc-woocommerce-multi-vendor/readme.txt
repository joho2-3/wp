We are extremely responsive to support requests - so if you face a problem or find any bugs, shoot us a mail or post it in the support forum, and we will respond within 12 hours (during business days). If you get the impulse to rate the plugin low because it is not working as it should, please do wait for our response because the root cause of the problem may be something else.
